DeepThought
===========

This was a bot I made for The Wits 2013 Robocode event. I really started it at 4am the morning of the event. Quite bad although the guy running the robotics group said my idea was promising. Basically a set of state machines and bisection for aiming in a small arc. That way bullets are picked up and shot as well a enemies.

Note
=====

I made this with eclipse but I seem to have misplaced my source code.
This is the version I submitted online to my university and so I was able to recover that Java file.

This is quite a badly coded AI.

If I find my original code I will add that to the repo.

I may merge this into another repository at some point.
