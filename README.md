DeepThought
===========

This was a bot I made for The Wits 2013 Robocode event. I really started it at 4am the morning of the event. Quite bad although the guy running the robotics group said my idea was promising. Basically a set of state machienes and bisection for aiming in a small arc. That way bullets are picked up and shot as well a enemies.
